# send-feedback

This electron-element, custom element designed to work for electron apps, 
is can be used to send feedback from webapp to a website.
Currently this works well for reporting issue to github's issue tracker.
But you can have simple website up that takes a report passed through `?body` url parameter.

See the [docs for documentation.](https://cPhost.github.io/send-feedback)
