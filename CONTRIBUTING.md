## Contributing

Every contribution is greatly welcomed.

# Install dependencies
First install npm dependecies.
```
npm i
```

After that, you can run `npm start` to run electron app to test the changes you make.

## Testing your code and running linter
Before you make a PR make sure that test and linter passes.
Linter can be ran by `npm run lint` and test by running `npm run unit-tests`.
Ideally once you have your code finalized just run `npm test` that runs both linter
and unit tests.
